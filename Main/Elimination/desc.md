# Py-Kathon 25: Elimination Stage Rules & Expectations

## Stage Overview

The **Elimination Stage** of Py-Kathon 25 is designed to test contestants' ability to quickly analyze and reconstruct scrambled Python code. This stage is entirely **speed-based**, meaning the fastest correct responses will determine who advances.

## Rules & Guidelines

### 1. Code Scrambling Format

- Each contestant will be presented with a scrambled Python code snippet.
- The lines of code will be out of order, and contestants must determine the correct sequence.

### 2. Answering the Challenge

- Contestants must **quickly state** the correct order of the scrambled code.
- Answers must be provided **in the exact sequence** as the correctly structured code.
- Minor syntax mistakes (such as missing colons or indentations) will be considered but should not impact the logical sequence.

### 3. Speed-Based Selection

- The challenge operates on a **first-come, first-correct** basis.
- The **first 8 contestants** to submit the correct sequence will automatically advance to the **Quarter-Finals**.
- If multiple contestants submit correct answers simultaneously, the system will timestamp responses to ensure fairness.

### 4. Disqualifications & Penalties

- Any form of **external assistance** (collaborating, using online compilers, or copying) will lead to **instant disqualification**.
- Incorrect or incomplete answers will not be considered for advancement.
- Disruptive behavior or contest misconduct may result in a warning or removal from the competition.

### 5. Time Limit

- While there is no fixed time limit per question, contestants must respond as quickly as possible.
- The round continues until all 8 advancing slots are filled.

## What is Expected from Contestants?

- Strong **understanding of Python syntax and structure**.
- Quick logical thinking to reconstruct the code accurately.
- Fast typing and response time to secure a top spot.
- Adherence to all competition rules to maintain fairness.

The **Elimination Stage** is designed to be a rapid-fire challenge, ensuring that only the most agile problem-solvers move forward. Best of luck to all contestants!
